## Benefits of Flutter
- Compiles efficiently to native code
- Cross-platform
- Supports reactive programming for responsive UI(Hot reload)
- Similar to Javascript
- Object Oriented
- Optimized for UI (Smooth Animations)

## Fundamental Concepts of Dart Programming
- Everything in a variable is an object
- Every object is an instance of a class(including numbers, functions and NULL if null safety is not enabled)
- If null safety is enabled, a variable is nullable with a question mark
	```dart
		int? nullable = null 
	```
- `null` supports generic types like lists of objects
- Simplify code with classes and objects
- Manage network requests with futures and streams

### Iterables Iterators and Collections

Collections represent groups of objects called elements

Collections include lists, maps, sets, etc.

Iterables are collections of elements that can be accessed sequentially and work with objects like lists and sets

Iterators are good for looping through data

Iterators are an interface for accessing elements from an iterable
