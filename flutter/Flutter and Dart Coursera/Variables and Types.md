## Variable Declaration

Variables act as placeholders for storing data

Data types specify which kind of data a variable can hold

Variables must be declared and given a value

```dart
	var variable = 3;
```
Can be declared with the keywords `var` `const` or `final`

### var

var declares a variable without explicitly specifying a data type

The data type will be inferred 

The variable can then be reassigned to another value of the same type

### const

Compile time constant

Cannot be changed

### final

Set at runtime

Once it is set, it cannot be changed

## Data Types

Statically typed so every variable must have a type

Types include 
- Numbers
	- int
	- double
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Maps

### Strings

May use single or double quotes
