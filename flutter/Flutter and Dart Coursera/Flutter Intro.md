> 
> This course consists of five modules:
> 
> **Module 1: Introduction to Flutter and Dart**
> 
> In this module, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of Flutter’s components. You will explore Flutter’s cross-platform capabilities and how they work together to create efficient and visually appealing apps. The module will also delve into the Flutter toolchain, software development kit or SDK, and essential utilities, providing the necessary tools for building and debugging your Flutter apps. You’ll also learn the significance of Dart, the programming language that powers Flutter, and its role in creating robust and scalable applications.
> 
> **Module 2: Exploring Dart Language**
> 
> In this module, you will master the fundamentals of Dart programming. You will work with and manipulate variables and data types. This module also explores the distinction between functions and methods, helping you use them to modularize your code. This module also covers Dart libraries and the Dart command line to streamline development. You will also use editors and debuggers to identify and fix errors in your code effectively. Finally, the module has a practice quiz and a graded quiz to solidify your Dart programming skills.
> 
> **Module 3: Working with Flutter**
> 
> In this module, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of Flutter’s UI concepts and navigation mechanics to create visually appealing apps. You will understand how to guide users between different screens within your app seamlessly. The module delves into the user experience concepts, discussing how to design intuitive and engaging interfaces. You will create a basic Flutter app from scratch by applying the concepts learned in the module. You will also learn how to implement styles and customize the appearance of your app to match your intended design. Finally, a practice quiz and graded quiz will help reinforce your knowledge of app creation.
> 
> **Module 4: Advanced Flutter**
> 
> By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of Flutter’s ecosystem and capabilities. You’ll learn to utilize plugins to extend Flutter’s functionality effectively and access native mobile features. This module examines state management, exploring different techniques and best practices for managing data within your Flutter app. You’ll also gain expertise in making API calls, interacting with external services, and retrieving data. You'll also be introduced to data persistence and using local storage with Flutter. Finally, a practice quiz and graded quiz will reinforce your knowledge of plugins, API calls, and persistence.
> 
> **Module 5: Final Project**
> 
> In this final module, you will apply Flutter skills by creating a comprehensive mobile app. You will build a basic app structure, add navigation features, and incorporate Flutter components. You’ll integrate APIs into your app to add functionality and connect to external data. Finally, you will simulate real-world scenarios to test your app’s performance.
> 
> **Tools/Software used**
